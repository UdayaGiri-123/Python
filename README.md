# Python
# Datatypes

**1.String
2. Numeric**

In Numeric it is again divided into int and float 

Python is a dynamically typed language. It means that unlike Java, we do not need to mention data types like # String or # Int before variable names.

Based on the data present on right hand side , it allocates respective data type accordingly
