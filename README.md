# Python

# Datatypes

**1.String
2. Numeric**

In Numeric it is again divided into int and float 

Python is a dynamically typed language. It means that unlike Java, we do not need to mention data types like # String or # Int before variable names.

Based on the data present on right hand side , it allocates respective data type accordingly

# Keywords in python :

There are few words which are reserved and have particular functionality in python. Those words are not allowed to be used
as variables to store any data as it will conflict and the interpreter can't process them.

Few of those keywords are :

1.And
2.Or
3.Not
4.for
5.while
6.if
7.else
8.elif
9.class
10.def
