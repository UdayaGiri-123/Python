# Functions:
Importance of using functions in code
1. Reusability
  When we define a function using 'def' keyword, it can be used anywhere in the code.
  Example : addition method once defined can be called multiple times
  def addition():
    add =  num1+num2
    print(add)
2. Readability
   When we define functions, it gives a structured format for our code reducing clumsyness.
3. Debugging
   It is also easier to debug the code
DRY - Don't repeat yourself
